# Project 5 - Reacting to input part I: Interrupts

1. Make led light on button press
2. Learn how to debug code by establish communication with the computer using the Serial library
3. Understand the difference between polling and interrupt and benefits of using interrupts over polling
4. Learn how to use interrupts in Arduino

## Light led on button press (arduino code)
 - button pin is 6, grove led pin is 4
 - read value from button pin. If button is pressed (how can you tell?) 
 turn grove led on. If button is not pressed, turn it off
 - test that this works.
 ```

## Simulate additional long process
- Add a delay(1000) to your loop. The purpose of this delay is to simulate an additional long process in your system, such as data acquisition, a long measurement, etc.
- add Serial statements before and after the delay
- test if lighting led still works. Why or why not?
answer here: The light on pin 4 may not work correctly because the delay(1000) function blocks the execution of the code, preventing the microcontroller from checking the button state during the delay period. This means that the LED state will only be updated once every second, leading to a delayed response to button presses.

## Use interrupt to light led
- Add code to create an interrupt pin (why can't it be the button pin?). Use a variable for this.
- Short the interrupt pin with the button pin
- test. Does it work?
